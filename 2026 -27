## What This Is

A lightweight, transparent automation that:

- Runs daily at **06:00 UTC**
- Pulls selected public documentation
- Generates a report
- Commits changes automatically
- Preserves a full audit trail via Git history

No credentials.  
No private data.  
No hidden behavior.

## How It Works

1. GitHub Actions runs on a daily cron
2. Public documentation is fetched
3. A report is written to `reports/daily.md`
4. Changes are committed by a bot identity
5. History remains fully inspectable
